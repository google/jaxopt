Hardware accelerated, batchable and differentiable optimizers in JAX.

- **Hardware accelerated:** our implementations run on GPU and TPU, in addition
  to CPU.
- **Batchable:** multiple instances of the same optimization problem can be
  automatically vectorized using JAX's vmap.
- **Differentiable:** optimization problem solutions can be differentiated with
  respect to their inputs either implicitly or via autodiff of unrolled
  algorithm iterations.

## Installation<a id="installation"></a>

JAXopt can be installed with pip directly from github, with the following
command:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/google/jaxopt
```

Alternatively, it can be be installed from sources with the following command:

```bash
$ python setup.py install
```
