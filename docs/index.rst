JAXopt
======

.. warning::
      This is the documentation for the development version of JAXopt.

Hardware accelerated, batchable and differentiable optimizers in
`JAX <https://github.com/google/jax>`_.

- **Hardware accelerated:** our implementations run on GPU and TPU, in addition
  to CPU.
- **Batchable:** multiple instances of the same optimization problem can be
  automatically vectorized using JAX's vmap.
- **Differentiable:** optimization problem solutions can be differentiated with
  respect to their inputs either implicitly or via autodiff of unrolled
  algorithm iterations.

Installation
------------

To install the latest release of JAXopt, use the following command::

    pip install jaxopt

To install the **development** version, use the following command instead::

    pip install git+https://github.com/google/jaxopt

Alternatively, it can be be installed from sources with the following command::

    python setup.py install
