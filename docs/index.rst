JAXopt Documentation
====================

Hardware accelerated, batchable and differentiable optimizers in JAX.

- **Hardware accelerated:** our implementations run on GPU and TPU, in addition
  to CPU.
- **Batchable:** multiple instances of the same optimization problem can be
  automatically vectorized using JAX's vmap.
- **Differentiable:** optimization problem solutions can be differentiated with
  respect to their inputs either implicitly or via autodiff of unrolled
  algorithm iterations.
