  Given a N x d ``data`` matrix, solves a bilevel optimization problem by

  Args:
    data: N x d jnp.ndarray, data matrix with N samples of d features.
    n_components: int, number of atoms in dictionary.
    regularization: regularization strength of elastic penalty.
    elastic_penalty: strength of L2 penalty relative to L1.
    task_vars_init: initializer for task related optimization variables.
    optimizer: If None, falls back on jaxopt proximal gradient (with sphere
      projection for ``dic``). If not ``None``, use that algorithm's method with
