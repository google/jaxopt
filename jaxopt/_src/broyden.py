  This method is a quasi-Newton approach to root finding.
  While similar to L-BFGS in spirit, it is not applied
  in the same situations: indeed, because the function
  whose root we are looking for is not necessarily a
  gradient, its Jacobian (i.e. its Hessian in the
  optimization case) is not necessarily symmetric.
  As a consequence, we cannot include symmetry in the
  secant conditions defining the updates of the Broyden
  matrices, and therefore the resulting Jacobian
  approximation is not symmetric, while it is for L-BFGS.
  Another consequence is that each Broyden update is of
  rank-1 while it is rank-2 for L-BFGS.

  Attributes:
    fun: a function of the form ``fun(x, *args, **kwargs)``.
    has_aux: whether ``fun`` outputs auxiliary data or not.
      If ``has_aux`` is False, ``fun`` is expected to be
        scalar-valued.
      If ``has_aux`` is True, then we have one of the following
        two cases.
      At each iteration of the algorithm, the auxiliary outputs are stored
        in ``state.aux``.

    maxiter: maximum number of Broyden iterations.
    tol: tolerance of the stopping criterion.

    stepsize: a stepsize to use (if <= 0, use backtracking line search),
      or a callable specifying the **positive** stepsize to use at each iteration.
    linesearch: the type of line search to use: for now only "backtracking" for backtracking
      line search is available.
    stop_if_linesearch_fails: whether to stop iterations if the line search fails.
      When True, this matches the behavior of core JAX.
    maxls: maximum number of iterations to use in the line search.
    decrease_factor: factor by which to decrease the stepsize during line search
      (default: 0.8).
    increase_factor: factor by which to increase the stepsize during line search
      (default: 1.5).
    max_stepsize: upper bound on stepsize.
    min_stepsize: lower bound on stepsize.

    history_size: size of the memory to use.
    gamma: the initialization of the inverse Jacobian is going to be gamma * I.

    implicit_diff: whether to enable implicit diff or autodiff of unrolled
      iterations.
    implicit_diff_solve: the linear system solver to use.

    jit: whether to JIT-compile the optimization loop (default: "auto").
    unroll: whether to unroll the optimization loop (default: "auto").

    verbose: whether to print error on every iteration or not.
      Warning: verbose=True will automatically disable jit.
